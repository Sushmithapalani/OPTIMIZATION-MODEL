In this project, I addressed a business problem involving production optimization using mathematical modeling and Python-based tools. The primary objective was to maximize the total profit derived from producing two products under certain machine capacity constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we employed Linear Programming (LP), a fundamental optimization technique widely used in operations research and industrial engineering to determine the best outcome—such as maximum profit or minimum cost—subject to linear relationships. The implementation leveraged PuLP, a powerful open-source Python library specifically designed for formulating and solving linear and integer programming problems. PuLP allows users to define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints in a highly intuitive way, and interfaces seamlessly with underlying solvers like CBC or GLPK to compute optimal solutions.
Additionally, we used Python as the primary programming language because of its readability, vast ecosystem, and suitability for both mathematical modeling and automation of business workflows. Within Python, PuLP handled the optimization logic by enabling us to represent the business scenario as a mathematical model. Decision variables represented the quantities of products to produce, the objective function captured the total profit, and the constraints modeled machine time limitations. Once defined, PuLP’s solver efficiently processed these inputs to find the optimal production plan that maximizes profit.
While this example specifically used PuLP for linear programming, the broader Python ecosystem offers numerous complementary tools. For data manipulation and exploration, libraries like pandas provide robust data structures to clean, transform, and analyze tabular data, which is crucial for understanding constraints and coefficients before optimization. Similarly, NumPy aids with efficient numerical computations that often underlie constraint matrix formulation. If visualization were required to understand feasible regions or sensitivity analyses, Matplotlib and Seaborn would be ideal choices to graph constraints and solutions, offering insights into how changes in parameters impact the optimal decision.
This optimization approach and toolset have diverse real-world applications. In manufacturing, linear programming helps determine how many units of different products to produce within machine and labor limits to maximize profits or minimize costs. In logistics and supply chain management, it is used for fleet routing, warehouse allocation, and inventory optimization. In finance, similar models assist in portfolio optimization, balancing risk and return under investment constraints. Retailers employ these techniques to set pricing and promotional mixes that maximize revenue within budget limits. Even service industries like healthcare use linear programming to allocate staff and equipment optimally across shifts or departments.
In summary, this project showcased how a combination of mathematical optimization and Python libraries—primarily PuLP—can be effectively used to model, solve, and derive actionable insights from business problems involving resource allocation and profit maximization. This demonstrates not only the versatility of Python for solving classical operations research problems but also highlights its value in automating complex decision-making processes across various industries, leading to data-driven and optimal business strategies
